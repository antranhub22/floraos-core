# FLORAOS COORDINATOR — CONSISTENCY MATRIX

**Document ID:** FLORAOS-COORD-CONSISTENCY-001  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Canonical Cross-Document Validation Layer  
**Purpose:** Verify that Operations, User Journey, Workflow, Templates, Database, PRD/UI and AI Agent implementation remain synchronized.

---

## 1. Canonical Rule

This matrix is the cross-document contract for Coordinator Operations.

Every implementation unit must be traceable across:

```text
Business Process
→ User Journey
→ Workflow
→ Template
→ Database
→ Status
→ Automation
→ UI/API
→ Evidence
→ Test
```

If a change cannot be mapped across affected layers, it is not implementation-ready.

---

## 2. Canonical Lifecycle

```text
NEW
→ VALIDATING
→ READY_FOR_PLANNING
→ PLANNED
→ FINDING_PARTNER
→ PARTNER_PENDING
→ PARTNER_CONFIRMED
→ IN_PRODUCTION
→ READY_FOR_QC
→ QC_PENDING
→ QC_PASSED
→ READY_FOR_DELIVERY
→ IN_DELIVERY
→ DELIVERED
→ CLOSING
→ COMPLETED
```

### Exception overlay

`EXCEPTION_OPEN` is NOT an `order_status`.

It is an operational overlay linked to `exceptions`.

Examples:

```text
IN_PRODUCTION + EXCEPTION_OPEN
QC_PENDING + EXCEPTION_OPEN
IN_DELIVERY + EXCEPTION_OPEN
```

## 3. Workstream Mapping

| WS | Canonical Workstream | Playbook Section | Main Journey Area |
|---|---|---|---|
| WS01 | Receive Order | 01 Nhận đơn | Sales handover + validation |
| WS02 | Plan Order | 02 Kiểm tra & lập kế hoạch | Order planning |
| WS03 | Assign Partner | 03 Tìm & xác nhận Shop | Partner matching/confirmation |
| WS04 | Execute Order | 04 Theo dõi Shop gia công | Production |
| WS05 | Control & QC | 05 Kiểm tra & QC | QC/rework |
| WS06 | Deliver Order | 06 Điều phối giao hàng | Delivery/POD |
| WS07 | Close & Learn | 07 Hoàn tất đơn | Closure/learning |

## 5. End-to-End Workflow Matrix

### WS01 — Receive Order

```text
T01
 ↓
T02
 ├── complete → READY_FOR_PLANNING
 └── incomplete → T03 → revalidate
```

### WS02 — Plan Order

```text
T05
 ↓
PLANNED
 ↓
FINDING_PARTNER
```

Order changes use T04 and must trigger validation/replanning where affected.

### WS03 — Assign Partner

```text
T06
 ↓
T07
 ↓
T08 ACCEPT → PARTNER_CONFIRMED
T09 QUESTION → Coordinator task → PARTNER_PENDING
DECLINE → next candidate / T24 if replacement required
```

### WS04 — Execute Order

```text
T10
 ↓
IN_PRODUCTION
 ├── normal → T12
 └── issue → T11 → T22 / escalation if needed
T12 → READY_FOR_QC
```

### WS05 — Control & QC

```text
T13
 ↓
T14
 ↓
T15
 ├── PASS → QC_PASSED → T18
 └── REVIEW/FAIL → T16 or T17
                       ↓
                    T10/T12 or T24
```

### WS06 — Deliver Order

```text
T18
 ↓
T19
 ↓
T20
 ├── normal → T21
 └── delivery issue → T22 → T23 if escalation required
T21 → DELIVERED
```

### WS07 — Close & Learn

```text

COMPLETED
 ├── T26 Partner Performance
 └── T27 Order Learning
```

## 6. Database Traceability

Every template must map to canonical entities, never to a duplicate module database.

```text
T01/T02/T03/T04/T05
→ orders / order_items / order_requirements / order_events

T06/T07/T08/T09/T24
→ partners / partner_candidates / partner_assignments / production_orders / comments

T10/T11/T12
→ production_orders / production_updates / production_issues / exceptions / order_events

T13/T14/T15/T16/T17
→ qc_requests / qc_checklists / qc_results / qc_issues / ai_analyses / exceptions

T18/T19/T20/T21
→ deliveries / delivery_updates / proof_of_delivery

T22/T23
→ exceptions / escalations

T25/T26/T27
→ orders / order_events / partner_performance / order_learning
```

---

## 7. User Journey Traceability

| Journey Intent | Workflow | Templates | Data |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sales submits order | Receive | T01 | orders/items/requirements |
| AI validates | Validate | T02/T03 | requirements/ai |
| Coordinator plans | Plan | T05 | orders/requirements |
| Partner matching | Assign | T06 | candidates |
| Partner confirmation | Assign | T07/T08/T09/T24 | assignments/production |
| Production monitoring | Execute | T10/T11/T12 | production |
| Exception intervention | Cross-cutting | T11/T22/T23/T24 | exceptions/escalations |
| QC | Control | T13/T14/T15 | qc/ai |
| Rework/replacement | Control | T16/T17 | qc issues/exceptions |
| Delivery | Deliver | T18/T19/T20/T21 | delivery/POD |
| Closure | Close | T25 | orders/events |
| Learning | Learn | T26/T27 | performance/learning |

|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Order extraction | ✓ | ✓ | Review when needed |
| Missing information detection | ✓ | ✓ | Resolve ambiguity |
| Partner matching | ✓ | ✓ | Approve/override |
| Partner communication | Draft/classify | Send/remind | Judgment |
| Delay detection | ✓ | ✓ | Intervention |
| QC image analysis | ✓ | ✓ | Final decision in MVP |
| Exception diagnosis | Assist | Create alert/task | Resolve |

## 9. Synchronization Rules

### Rule 01
A new template requires a Workflow mapping.

### Rule 02
A new workflow requires a Journey mapping.

### Rule 03
A new DB entity requires a business purpose and Workflow mapping.

### Rule 04
A new status must be approved in the canonical lifecycle before implementation.

### Rule 05
Exceptions use the exception overlay and do not create a competing order lifecycle.

### Rule 06
Changes to one layer must trigger a dependency review across all affected layers.

### Rule 07
The existing FloraOS repository remains the implementation source of truth for actual code/schema conventions.

### Rule 08
Coordinator documents define the intended capability, not permission to replace existing infrastructure.

---

## 10. Pre-Coding Gate

Before coding any Coordinator feature, the AI Agent must be able to answer:

```text
1. Which existing entity does this use?
2. Which Workstream?
3. Which Journey stage?
4. Which Workflow?
5. Which Template?
6. Which DB read/write?
7. Which status transition?
8. Which automation?
9. Which evidence?
10. Which exception path?
11. Which permission?
12. Which tests?
```

If any answer is missing, implementation must pause at design level rather than inventing an isolated solution.

---

## 11. Validation Status

This document is the checklist used whenever the Coordinator specification changes.

Target state:

```text
100% traceable
100% cross-referenced
0 duplicate source of truth
0 orphan templates
0 orphan workflow steps
0 undocumented status transitions
```
