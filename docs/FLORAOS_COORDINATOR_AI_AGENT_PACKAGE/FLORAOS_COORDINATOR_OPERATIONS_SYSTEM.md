# FloraOS — Coordinator Operations System
## System Documentation v1.0

> **Purpose:** Single Source of Truth for the Coordinator operating system.
>
> **Relationship:** This document defines how the operating system is designed. The companion `FLORAOS_COORDINATOR_PLAYBOOK.md` translates the same system into a simple human execution guide.
>
> **Synchronization rule:** The Workstream → Stage → Step taxonomy in this document is the canonical taxonomy. The Coordinator Playbook must not introduce a different process structure; it may simplify language and execution detail only.


> **IMPLEMENTATION CONTEXT — EXISTING SYSTEM EXTENSION**  
> Tài liệu này mô tả chức năng **Coordinator Operations** là một capability/module bổ sung vào **hệ thống FloraOS hiện có**, không phải một sản phẩm hoặc repository độc lập. Khi triển khai, AI Agent phải inspect repository hiện tại, tái sử dụng architecture, authentication, tenant model, database conventions, components, APIs, services và infrastructure đang có; không tạo một repo mới và không dựng lại các capability đã tồn tại.  
>  
> **Repository hiện tại là nguồn sự thật cho implementation detail.** Tài liệu này là canonical specification cho capability Coordinator. Nếu specification xung đột với behavior production hiện có, phải ưu tiên backward compatibility và ghi nhận gap/decision trước khi thay đổi behavior hiện hữu.

### Core principle

**Sales sells the order. Coordinator turns the sold order into a successfully delivered order through the Partner Network.**

Coordinator success is defined by:

> **Right requirement → Right partner → Right execution → Right quality → Right delivery → Right closure**

---

# 1. Role Definition

## 1.1 Coordinator Mission

The Coordinator is the operational owner of an order from the moment Sales hands it over until the order is successfully closed.

The Coordinator does not replace Sales, Partner, QC, or Delivery. The Coordinator **coordinates the complete order flow and owns operational continuity**.

## 1.2 Core Responsibilities

1. Receive and validate the order.
2. Convert customer requirements into an executable order plan.
3. Select and confirm an appropriate Partner.
4. Brief and coordinate Partner production.
5. Monitor progress and intervene when risk appears.
6. Coordinate quality control and rework/replacement when required.
7. Coordinate delivery.
8. Close the order and capture operational/Partner performance data.
9. Handle exceptions and escalate according to defined rules.

# 2. Coordinator Work Architecture

## L0 — Business Purpose

**Purpose:** Deliver every accepted FloraOS order accurately, on time, with the required quality and within the approved commercial/operational constraints.

## L1 — Workstreams

| ID | Workstream | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| WS01 | Receive Order | Receive and validate the Sales handover |
| WS02 | Plan Order | Convert the customer order into an executable production/delivery plan |
| WS03 | Assign Partner | Select and confirm the appropriate Partner |
| WS04 | Execute Order | Coordinate Partner production |
| WS05 | Control & QC | Verify the actual product against requirements |
| WS06 | Deliver Order | Coordinate successful delivery |
| WS07 | Close & Learn | Close the order and capture learning/performance |

These seven Workstreams are the canonical structure used by the Coordinator Playbook.

# 5. L4 — Action Standard

Every operational Step should ultimately be executable through a small set of actions:

**Check → Confirm → Communicate → Update → Monitor → Escalate → Close**

Actions must always identify:
- What is checked?
- Who is contacted?
- What evidence is required?
- What system status changes?
- What happens if the expected condition is not met?

---

# 6. L5 — Decision Rules

The system uses decision gates rather than assuming every order follows a perfect linear path.

## Gate A — Order Ready?

- **YES:** Continue to WS02.
- **NO:** Clarify with Sales/order owner.

## Gate B — Partner Suitable?

- **YES:** Send brief and confirm.
- **NO:** Evaluate next candidate.

## Gate C — Partner Accepted?

- **YES:** Lock assignment.
- **NO:** Return to Partner selection.

## Gate D — Production On Track?

- **YES:** Continue monitoring.
- **NO:** Assess recovery or escalate.

## Gate E — QC Pass?

- **YES:** Continue to WS06.
- **NO:** Rework/replacement according to severity.

## Gate F — Delivery Successful?

- **YES:** Continue to WS07.
- **NO:** Activate delivery exception handling.

---

# 7. L6 — Exception Architecture

Exceptions are grouped into five categories:

1. **Information Exception** — missing/incorrect/contradictory order information.
2. **Partner Exception** — decline, capacity, capability, responsiveness, or performance issue.
3. **Production Exception** — material shortage, quality risk, delay, or deviation.
4. **Delivery Exception** — pickup, route, recipient, address, or timing issue.
5. **Customer/Commercial Exception** — change request, cancellation, additional requirement, or commercial conflict.

General response pattern:

**Detect → Assess impact → Contain → Resolve / Escalate → Record → Resume or Replace**

---

# 8. L7 — Output & Evidence

| Workstream | Required output/evidence |
|---|---|
| WS01 | Validated operational order |
| WS02 | Order plan / production & delivery requirements |
| WS03 | Confirmed Partner + accepted brief |
| WS04 | Production status + completion evidence |
| WS05 | QC result / approval or rework decision |
| WS06 | Delivery confirmation + POD |
| WS07 | Completed order + performance/learning record |

---

# 9. L8 — Status Model

Recommended canonical order lifecycle:

`NEW → VALIDATING → READY_FOR_PLANNING → PLANNED → FINDING_PARTNER → PARTNER_PENDING → PARTNER_CONFIRMED → IN_PRODUCTION → READY_FOR_QC → QC_PENDING → QC_PASSED → READY_FOR_DELIVERY → IN_DELIVERY → DELIVERED → CLOSING → COMPLETED`

Exception statuses may be layered separately and should not replace the primary lifecycle unless the system requires it.

---

# 10. L9 — Roles / RACI

| Activity | Sales | Coordinator | Partner | Delivery | Leader |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Order sale | A/R | I | I | I | I |
| Order handover | R | A/R | I | I | I |
| Order validation | C | A/R | I | I | I |
| Partner selection | C | A/R | I | I | C |
| Production | I | A | R | I | I |
| Production monitoring | I | A/R | R | I | I |
| QC coordination | C | A/R | R | I | C |
| Delivery coordination | I | A/R | R | R | I |
| Exception escalation | C | R | C | C | A |
| Order closure | I | A/R | C | C | I |
| Partner performance record | I | A/R | C | I | C |

**A = Accountable, R = Responsible, C = Consulted, I = Informed**

---

# 11. L10 — SLA / KPI Framework

The exact numerical SLA should be configured by order type and service level. The architecture should measure:

### Speed
- Sales handover → operational acceptance
- Operational acceptance → Partner confirmation
- Partner confirmation → production start
- Production completion → QC result
- QC pass → pickup
- Pickup → delivery

### Quality
- QC pass rate
- Rework rate
- Replacement rate
- Order defect rate

### Reliability
- On-time production
- On-time delivery
- Partner acceptance rate
- Failed delivery rate

### Overall
- **OTIF — On Time In Full**
- Exception rate
- Order completion rate

---

# 12. L11 — System / Automation Layer

The digital system should eventually support:

- Automatic status progression
- Missing-information alerts
- Partner matching
- Partner availability/capacity visibility
- Deadline countdown
- Delay-risk alerts
- QC evidence capture
- Delivery tracking
- Exception queues
- Partner performance scoring/data
- Audit trail

Automation should enforce the process, not create a second conflicting process.

---

# 13. L12 — Governance

## Change control

Changes to:
- Workstream
- Stage
- Step
- Decision rule
- Status
- SLA
- KPI
- RACI

must be reflected in the canonical System Documentation first.

The Coordinator Playbook is then updated from the approved system change.

## Synchronization rule

**System Documentation → Process Specification → Coordinator Playbook → Training**

Never make a Playbook-only process change that contradicts the system architecture.

This mapping is mandatory for synchronization.
