# FloraOS — Coordinator Template Architecture
## Template System v1.0

> **Purpose:** Define the canonical template architecture for the Coordinator operating system.
>
> **Relationship:** Templates are the operational interface between Sales, Coordinator, Partner, QC and Delivery. They must use the canonical Order Object and must not create a second source of truth.


> **IMPLEMENTATION CONTEXT — EXISTING SYSTEM EXTENSION**  
> Tài liệu này mô tả chức năng **Coordinator Operations** là một capability/module bổ sung vào **hệ thống FloraOS hiện có**, không phải một sản phẩm hoặc repository độc lập. Khi triển khai, AI Agent phải inspect repository hiện tại, tái sử dụng architecture, authentication, tenant model, database conventions, components, APIs, services và infrastructure đang có; không tạo một repo mới và không dựng lại các capability đã tồn tại.  
>  
> **Repository hiện tại là nguồn sự thật cho implementation detail.** Tài liệu này là canonical specification cho capability Coordinator. Nếu specification xung đột với behavior production hiện có, phải ưu tiên backward compatibility và ghi nhận gap/decision trước khi thay đổi behavior hiện hữu.

# 1. Template Architecture Principle

```text
ONE ORDER OBJECT
       ↓
Template Engine
       ↓
Role-specific Views
       ├── Sales View
       ├── Coordinator View
       ├── Partner View
       ├── QC View
       └── Delivery View
```

The same order data is transformed into different templates according to:

- Role
- Stage
- Purpose
- Channel
- Required action

## Core principle

> **Input once → structure once → reuse everywhere.**

---

# 2. Template Anatomy

Every template must define:

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| Template ID | Unique identifier |
| Name | Human-readable name |
| Purpose | Why the template exists |
| Trigger | What causes it to appear/send |
| Owner | Who creates/controls it |
| Recipient | Who receives it |
| Stage | Where it belongs in order lifecycle |
| Channel | Web / WhatsApp / Zalo / Email / internal |
| Input Source | Where data comes from |
| Auto Fields | System-populated |
| AI Fields | AI-generated |
| Manual Fields | Human-entered |
| Required Fields | Mandatory |
| Optional Fields | Optional |
| CTA | Available actions |
| Status Change | Resulting order/status change |
| Evidence | Required proof |
| Automation | Follow-up automation |
| Version | Template version |

---

# 3. Field Classification

Every field must be classified as one of four types.

### SYSTEM
Automatically populated from Order Object.

Example:
- Order ID
- Customer
- Deadline
- Partner

### AI
Generated or interpreted by AI.

Example:
- Order summary
- Risk explanation
- Partner brief wording
- QC observation

### HUMAN
Entered or confirmed by a user.

Example:
- Special instruction
- Exception decision
- Override reason

### PARTNER
Entered/confirmed by Partner.

Example:
- Accept/decline
- ETA
- Material issue
- Production completion

1. Show only information relevant to the recipient.
2. Use structured fields whenever possible.
3. Prefer buttons over free-text responses.
4. Allow free text as fallback.
5. Never duplicate data entry.
6. Every action should update the Order Object.
7. Every exception should have owner + next action.
8. Every important completion should have evidence.
9. AI-generated content must be visually identifiable where necessary.
10. Template changes require versioning.

# 27. Template Governance

The template system must follow:

```text
System Documentation
       ↓
Process Specification
       ↓
Template Specification
       ↓
UI / Message Template
       ↓
Automation
```

A template must never become the source of business rules.

Business rules remain in the System Documentation.
