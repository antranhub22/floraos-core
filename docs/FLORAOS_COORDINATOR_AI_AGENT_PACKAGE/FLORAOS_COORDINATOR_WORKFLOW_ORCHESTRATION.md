# FLORAOS COORDINATOR — WORKFLOW ORCHESTRATION

**Document ID:** FLORAOS-COORD-WORKFLOW-001  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Canonical Workflow Contract  
**Scope:** Coordinator Operations as an extension of the existing FloraOS system

---

## 1. Purpose

Đây là lớp **orchestration** nối toàn bộ:

```text
Business System
→ User Journey
→ Workstream / Stage / Step
→ Business Action
→ Template
→ Actor
→ Rule / Decision
→ Database
→ Status Transition
→ Automation
→ Evidence
→ Next Action
```

Đây là tài liệu quan trọng nhất để đảm bảo các file khác không phát triển độc lập.

## 2. Existing-System Rule

Coordinator là **module bổ sung vào hệ thống FloraOS hiện có**.

AI Agent MUST:

- inspect existing repository before coding;
- reuse existing auth, users, organizations/tenants, customers, orders, partners, storage, notifications, API conventions and UI components when available;
- extend existing models rather than duplicating them;
- preserve current production behavior;
- avoid creating a second order/customer/partner source of truth;
- avoid creating a second authentication or tenant system;
- avoid creating a separate Coordinator application/repository.

# 3. Canonical Chain

Mọi workflow mới phải map được:

```text
WS
 ↓
Stage
 ↓
Step
 ↓
Action
 ↓
Template
 ↓
Actor
 ↓
Input
 ↓
Decision
 ↓
DB Read/Write
 ↓
Status Transition
 ↓
Automation
 ↓
Evidence
 ↓
Next Action
```

Nếu một implementation không map được chain này, nó chưa được coi là hoàn chỉnh.

# 4. Source-of-Truth Hierarchy

Khi coding:

1. Existing production behavior — để bảo vệ backward compatibility.
2. Existing repository schema/API/auth/tenant conventions.
3. Coordinator System Architecture.
4. Coordinator Workflow Orchestration.
5. Database Architecture.
6. User Journey.
7. Template Architecture.
8. PRD/Wireframe.
9. Playbook.

Nếu có conflict:

```text
DO NOT silently overwrite.
→ document gap
→ choose backward-compatible implementation
→ record decision
```

# 7. Exception Overlay Model

`EXCEPTION_OPEN` is **not** a canonical order lifecycle status. It is an operational overlay attached to an order/exception record.

```text
Canonical Order Status
        +
Exception Overlay (OPEN / RESOLVED)
```

Examples:

```text
IN_PRODUCTION + EXCEPTION_OPEN
QC_PENDING + EXCEPTION_OPEN
IN_DELIVERY + EXCEPTION_OPEN
```

When the exception is resolved, the order returns/continues through the canonical lifecycle.

---

# 7. Decision Matrix

## Partner response

```text
ACCEPT
→ PARTNER_CONFIRMED
→ create/activate production order

QUESTION
→ PARTNER_PENDING
→ coordinator task

DECLINE
→ partner candidate rejected
→ exception if required
→ next candidate / replacement
```

## QC

```text
PASS
→ QC_PASSED
→ READY_FOR_DELIVERY

FAIL / REWORK
→ exception / qc issue
→ IN_PRODUCTION
→ rework
→ QC again
```

## Delivery

```text
DELIVERED + POD
→ CLOSING
→ COMPLETED
```

# 8. Workflow Invariants

1. Every active order has owner, next action, deadline and risk.
2. Every important status transition produces an event.
3. Every template has a business purpose and a stage.
4. Every business action writes to canonical DB entities.
5. Every completion requiring evidence stores evidence.
6. AI recommendation does not equal business decision.
7. Exceptions are cross-cutting and should not destroy the main lifecycle.
8. A template cannot invent a new status without updating the canonical lifecycle.
9. UI state must not become the only source of workflow truth.
10. Automation must be idempotent.

---

# 9. Workflow Definition Format

Every future workflow must be documented in this form:

```yaml
workflow_id: WF-XXX
workstream: WSXX
stage: STXX
step: STEPXX
action: ACTIONXX

trigger:
  type: event|schedule|human|ai

actor:
  primary: coordinator
  secondary: partner

input:
  - entity.field

template:
  outbound: TXX
  inbound: TXX

decision:
  - condition: ...
    result: ...

database:
  reads:
    - table.field
  writes:
    - table.field

status:
  from: ...
  to: ...

automation:
  - ...

evidence:
  required: true
  source: ...

next_action:
  ...

exception:
  possible: true
```

# 10. Definition of Done

A workflow is not done until:

- [ ] Journey step exists.
- [ ] System stage exists.
- [ ] Template is mapped.
- [ ] Actor is defined.
- [ ] Input/output is defined.
- [ ] DB read/write is defined.
- [ ] Status transition is defined.
- [ ] Automation is defined.
- [ ] Evidence is defined.
- [ ] Exception path is defined.
- [ ] Next action is defined.
- [ ] Existing-system impact is reviewed.
